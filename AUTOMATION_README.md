3. Upload the Excel file using the file input
4. Select a credential from the loaded list
5. Click "Sign In" to execute the automation

## Excel File Format

| Email | Password | Name | Description |
|-------|----------|------|-------------|
| user1@example.com | password123 | Primary Account | Main testing account |
| user2@example.com | password456 | Secondary Account | Backup account |

## API Endpoints

## Technical Details

### Frontend Components
- `SignIn.tsx`: Main automation interface component
- `credentials.ts`: TypeScript types for credential management
- Updated `SideBar.tsx`: Added automation navigation option
- Updated `App.tsx`: Added automation route

### Backend Integration
- Flask API endpoint for executing Selenium scripts
- Dynamic script generation with provided credentials
- Threaded execution to prevent blocking
- Comprehensive error handling and status reporting

### Dependencies Added
- `xlsx`: For Excel file reading
- `@types/xlsx`: TypeScript definitions for Excel library

## Security Considerations

- Passwords are masked in the UI (shown as dots)
- Credentials are not stored permanently in the application
- Temporary scripts are cleaned up after execution
- No hardcoded credentials in the application

## Prerequisites

- ChromeDriver must be installed and accessible in PATH
- Selenium WebDriver Python package must be installed
- Python 3.x runtime environment

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **ChromeDriver not found**: Ensure ChromeDriver is installed and in PATH
2. **Excel format errors**: Use the provided sample template
3. **Sign-in failures**: Verify credentials and website accessibility
4. **Timeout errors**: Check network connectivity and website response time

### Error Messages
- "Script execution timed out": Increase timeout or check ChromeDriver
- "Error reading Excel file": Verify file format and column names
- "Sign-in automation failed": Check credentials and website status
